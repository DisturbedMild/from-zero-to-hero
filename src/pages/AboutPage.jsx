          <p>
            You’ve probably heard of the 10,000 hour rule, which was popularized
            by Malcolm Gladwell’s blockbuster book
            <a
              href="https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930"

              “Outliers.”
            </a>
            As Gladwell tells it, the rule goes like this: it takes 10,000 hours
            of intensive practice to achieve mastery of complex skills and
            materials, like playing the violin or getting as good as Bill Gates
            at computer programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gladwell describes one central study in particular, about which he
            writes: “their research suggests that once a musician has enough
            ability to get into a top music school, the thing that distinguishes
            one performer from another is how hard he or she works. That’s it.”
